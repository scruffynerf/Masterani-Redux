# Masterani Redux by Wilson Magic
A complete rewrite of the scraper system in Alleidun's Masterani addon for Kodi.
Includes multiple fixes based on the code of reddit user and addon developer SirTakoyaki.

I will continue to update this repository for the forseeable future, however, if you want automatic updates, I would recommend adding my official Kodi repository, "Magicality". This can be downloaded by adding https://wilson-magic.github.io/repo/ to the Kodi file manager and installing it how you would any other addon or going to this link to download it: https://github.com/Wilson-Magic/repository.magicality
